# Credit-Card-Fraud
The goal is to reduce credit card fraud to help banks and credit card compnaies make smarter decisions when choosing to give someone a loan and a credit card limit.
This project was created from unstructured credit card data to see if it's possible to detect credit card fraud before it happens.

## Project Scenario
American Express has been having a lot of credit card fraud lately during the pandemic. Since a lot of people have lost their jobs and no one is able to pay them back as of now, Amex wants to differentiate fraudulent transactions from real transactions. Amex was kind enough to share their data on their customers but because of security reasons, they decided to give us unlabeled data, covering up the patients demographics.
